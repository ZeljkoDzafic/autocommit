# Autocommit
This is a simple tool  created due to fact we have some old school devs
that hate GIT and only use SSH / FTP and IDE

The auto-commit tool will sync changes from the development environment to the specific directory that contains repo of the project
check are there any changes  and create new branch  and commit code
